# Cpp Reference

C++ libraries are complex, fragmented, and hard to find well abstracted libraries.

my personal reference is easy to use.(especially useful for beginner)

any comments on the source code are welcome.

However, additional library is included.

Please check the libraries below, as they are licensed individually.

- [Cryptopp 8.6.0](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp) : Boost License

# 2. Environment


OS : Windows 10 and 11

Complier : Visual Studio 2022 / C++20 / x64 / MTd


I prefer to use the latest version.

whenever official versions of Windows OS, C++, Visual Studio, etc. are updated,

I will check the compatibility and update repositories

â€» there are currently no plans to write Linux code.

# 3. Introduce namespaces
- cyp::command
    + use the Windows command.
    + get command return string.
 
- cyp::communication
    + use Tcp
    + use Udp
    + use Udp multicast.

- cyp::encrypt
    + You can use AES encryption.
    + *except for AES 256, is not yet implemented properly...*
 
- cyp::file
    + You can create, delete, read, for files and folder.
    + *planning to provide a class that transfers files through TCP.*

- cyp::hardware
    + You can get monitors information (name, resolution, refresh rate, monitor position(x,y))

- cyp::hash

     You can use the hash function below for files and std::string.
    + MD5
    + SHA
     
     You can use the hash function below for std::string
    + PBKDF2
    + HKDF
   
- cyp::image
    + At the moment, have a code that can capture images simply (BMP, PNG).
    + *decided to support OpenCV in the future.*

- cyp::string
    + makes the std::string easier to use.
    
- cyp::timer
    + use Timer
    + use FpsCounter
    + run the callback function by attaching it to the timer (delay execution is possible)
 
- cyp::sharedMemory
    + use shared memory(shared memory allows data to be shared between processes.)

- cyp:hook
    + use Keyboard global hook. (need implement)
    + use Mouse global hook. (need implement)

# 4. Caution
   Avoid using dynamic libraries.

   The lib folder contains dynamic library folders, but will not contain any files.

   I deliberately avoid using dll for stability.
    
   This code has no binary purpose, is to be built by implanting it into another code.
    

   Therefore, using dynamic libraries faced a number of miscellaneous problems,
    
   use dynamic libraries only for the purpose of distributing programs.
