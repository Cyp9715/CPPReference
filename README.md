# Cpp Reference

C++ libraries are complex, fragmented, and hard to find well abstracted libraries.

my personal reference is easy to use.(especially useful for beginner)

any comments on the source code are welcome.

However, additional library is included.

please check the libraries below, as they are licensed individually.

- [Cryptopp 8.6.0](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp) : Boost License
- [OpenCV 4.6.0](https://opencv.org/license/) : Apache 2

I am currently planning to change the encryption library to OpenSSL in relation to '''FIPS 140''' compliance.

After changing related Hash and Encrypte functions to OpenSSL

I plan to add a file encryption TCP transmission function using OpenSSL as well.


# 2. Environment


OS : Windows 10 and 11

Complier : Visual Studio 2022 / C++20 / x64 / MTd


I prefer to use the latest version.

whenever official versions of Windows OS, C++, Visual Studio, etc. are updated,

I will check the compatibility and update repositories

â€» there are currently no plans to write Linux code.

# 3. Introduce namespaces
## 3-1. CypReference
include a lot of miscellaneous code.

- cyp::command
    + provide Windows command usage.
    + provide a function that return the result of command execution. 

- cyp::network
    + provide Tcp example
    + provide Udp example
    + provide Udp multicast example

- cyp::encrypt
    + provide AES encryption.
    + *except for AES 256, is not yet implemented properly...*
 
- cyp::file
    + create, delete, read, for files and folder
    + provide file transfer function (not encrypted).

- cyp::hardware
    + get monitors information (name, resolution, refresh rate, monitor position(x,y))

- cyp::hash

     use the hash function below for files and std::string.
    + MD5
    + SHA(SHA1, SHA2, SHA3)
     
     use the hash function below for std::string
    + PBKDF2
    + HKDF
   
- cyp::image
    + At the moment, have a code that can capture images simply (BMP, PNG). (will be changed to use OpenCV code in the future.)

- cyp::string
    + makes the std::string easier to use.
    
- cyp::timer
    + provide Timer
    + provide FpsCounter
    + run the callback function by attaching it to the timer (delay execution is possible)
 
- cyp::sharedMemory
    + provide shared memory(shared memory allows data to be shared between processes.)

- cyp:hook
    + provide Keyboard global hook. (need user implement)
    + provide Mouse global hook. (need user implement)

## 3-2. cypOpencvReference
*OpenCV related codes will be inserted.*

\* OpenCV version: 4.6.0
