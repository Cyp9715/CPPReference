# CPPReference

this repository is personal.

C++ libraries are complex, fragmented, and hard to find well abstracted libraries.

my personal library is easy to use.(especially useful for beginner)

any comments on the source code are welcome.

# 2. Environment


OS : Windows 10

Complier : C++17

Visual Studio Version : 2019


I prefer to use the latest version.

whenever windows OS, C++, visual studio... or etc are officially updated. 

I will check the compatibility and update repositories

# 3. caution

this code was created without thinking of continuous calls.

for this reason, some functions require modifications when used for the following purposes.

1. When analyzing large amounts of data.

    The cyp::vector::isContain() = has a time complexity of O(n). This is very inefficient.
